# Contributing to DataChain AI

We love your input! We want to make contributing to DataChain AI as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

### Coding Style Guidelines

- For Rust code (smart contracts), follow the [Rust style guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/style/README.html)
- For JavaScript/TypeScript code, we use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with Airbnb configuration
- For Python code (AI engine), we follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

## Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

## License

## Reporting Bugs

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/datachainai/datachain-ai/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Feature Requests

We love hearing about new features! Feel free to submit a feature request through the GitHub issues.
